1. 
Created a folder called 'Midterm' in a 'handin' folder
Created a file called 'midterm_shwang.ipynb' and put it into the 'Midterm' folder
Opened Github Desktop, checked the newly created files, clicked 'commit to main' after typing something in summary section, 
and clicked pushed to origin button 
In heading comments, typed my name, assignment number, and the date




2. 
	A) With print() function, gave information and available options about the trip to customers by : 
print("You are going to choose which cities you will travel between. These are the options available : Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, Miami, Minneapolis, Orlando, Sacramento, Tampa, Washington."
     "Please type the name of the city you want to begin your trip in start_city and the name of the city you want to end your trip in target_city.")

	B) asked the input start_city and target_city by : 
start_city = input("Where do you want to start your trip?: ")
target_city = input("Where do you want to end your trip?: ")

	C) Created a list of available options by : 
cities_list = [ 'Atlanta', 'Baltimore', 'Boston', 'Charlotte', 'Dallas', 'Denver', 'Miami', 'Minneapolis', 'Orlando', 
               'Sacramento', 'Tampa', 'Washington' ]

	D) Used while, not in function to make sure that customers type a right city name by showing an error when they type it wrong :
start_city = input("\nEnter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
while (start_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    start_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
target_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (target_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    target_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")

	E)





3. 
	A) imported umpy function by 'import numpy as np'
	Created travel_data with 'np.load.txt' and called the file 'distances_midterm.dat'
	Used input function to ask cities that travelers want to start or end their trip

	B) Copy-pasted the function I made in problem 2 part D and changed the name to first_city and second_city as :

first_city = input("\nEnter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
second_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (start_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    first_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
    second_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (target_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    first_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
    second_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")

	   Used print function to get the index of the cities as :
print( first_city, second_city )


	C) First, identified the index of first_city as location1 and second city as location2
		and defined miles as the distance between location1 and location2
		*int : removes any decimal points of number 

location1 = (cities_list.index(first_city))
location2 = (cities_list.index(second_city))
miles = (int (travel_data[location1, location2]))
print("Between first city and second city you will travel", miles, "miles.")

		- Using "miles," let the distance appear with the appropriate miles
