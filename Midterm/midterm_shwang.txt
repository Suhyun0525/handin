1. 
Created a folder called 'Midterm' in a 'handin' folder
Created a file called 'midterm_shwang.ipynb' and put it into the 'Midterm' folder
Opened Github Desktop, checked the newly created files, clicked 'commit to main' after typing something in summary section, 
and clicked pushed to origin button 
In heading comments, typed my name, assignment number, and the date




2. 
	A) With print() function, gave information and available options about the trip to customers by : 
print("You are going to choose which cities you will travel between. These are the options available : Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, Miami, Minneapolis, Orlando, Sacramento, Tampa, Washington."
     "Please type the name of the city you want to begin your trip in start_city and the name of the city you want to end your trip in target_city.")

	B) asked the input start_city and target_city by : 
start_city = input("Where do you want to start your trip?: ")
target_city = input("Where do you want to end your trip?: ")

	C) Created a list of available options by : 
cities_list = [ 'Atlanta', 'Baltimore', 'Boston', 'Charlotte', 'Dallas', 'Denver', 'Miami', 'Minneapolis', 'Orlando', 
               'Sacramento', 'Tampa', 'Washington' ]

	D) Used while, not in function to make sure that customers type a right city name by showing an error when they type it wrong :
start_city = input("\nEnter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
while (start_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    start_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
target_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (target_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    target_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")

	E)





3. 
	A) imported umpy function by 'import numpy as np'
	Created travel_data with 'np.load.txt' and called the file 'distances_midterm.dat'
	Used input function to ask cities that travelers want to start or end their trip

	B) Copy-pasted the function I made in problem 2 part D and changed the name to first_city and second_city as :

first_city = input("\nEnter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
second_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (start_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    first_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
    second_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (target_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    first_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
    second_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")

	   Used print function to get the index of the cities as :
print( first_city, second_city )


	C) First, identified the index of first_city as location1 and second city as location2
		and defined miles as the distance between location1 and location2
		*int : removes any decimal points of number 

location1 = (cities_list.index(first_city))
location2 = (cities_list.index(second_city))
miles = (int (travel_data[location1, location2]))
print("Between first city and second city you will travel", miles, "miles.")

		- Using "miles," let the distance appear with the appropriate miles 

	D) First, identified average speed and hours : 

avgSpeed = 75 
hours = miles/avgSpeed

	Set days, hours, and minutes as 0 to prevent 'undefine' error when they ended up having no value :

d = 0
h = 0 
m = 0 

	Used if/else function to represent the result into days, hours, and miutes
	
if (hours >= 24):
        d = int (hours/24)
        hours = hours % 24
        h = int (hours)
        hours = hours % 1
        m = int (60 * hours)
    else:
        h = int (hours)
        hours = hours % 1
        m = int (60 * hours)
    print("Your trip from first_city to second_city will take", d, "days,", h, "hours and", m, "minutes.")

	* % : shows the remnant of the values after division


	E) Defined departing city and arriving city for start_city and target_city :

start_city = input("\nEnter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
target_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (start_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    start_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    target_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")
while (target_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    start_city = input("Enter the city name from where to want to start trip: ")
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    target_city = input("Enter the city name where you want to reach at: ")

	Input Tampa as start_city and Orlando as target_city 
	
	Defined first_city as index of start_city and second_city as index of target_city

first_city = (cities_list.index(start_city))
second_city = (cities_list.index(target_city))
miles = (int (travel_data[first_city, second_city]))
print("Between Start_city and target_city you will travel", miles, "miles.")

	Calculated how long it takes from start_city to target_city by : 

locations = [start_city, target_city]
distanceTimeCalc(locations)

	It gave me 0 days, 1hour, 7 minutes




4. 
	A) Added pitstop for the input as : 

first_city = input("Where do you want to start your trip?: ")
while (first_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    first_city = input("Where do you want to start your trip?: ")
pitstop_city = input("Where do you want to pitspot your trip?: ")
while (pitstop_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    pitstop_city = input("Where do you want to pitspot your trip?: ")
second_city = input("Where do you want to end your trip?: ")
while(second_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    second_city = input("Where do you want to end your trip?: ")


	B,C,D)

def distanceTimeCalc2(locations):
    miles1 = (int (travel_data[cities_list.index(locations[0]), cities_list.index(locations[1])]))
    miles2 = (int (travel_data[cities_list.index(locations[1]), cities_list.index(locations[2])]))
    miles = miles1 + miles2
    mpg = 24.9
    fuel = 16 #gallons
    print("Between first city and second city you will travel", miles, "miles.")
    avgSpeed = 75 #mph
    hours = miles/avgSpeed
    d = 0 #days
    h = 0 #hours
    m = 0 #minutes
    if (hours >= 24):
        d = int (hours/24)
        hours = hours % 24
        h = int (hours)
        hours = hours % 1
        m = int (60 * hours)
    else:
        h = int (hours)
        hours = hours % 1
        m = int (60 * hours)
    print("Your trip from first_city to second_city will take", d, "days,", h, "hours and", m, "minutes.")
    
    rangex = mpg * fuel
    costperfill = 16*2.4
    refill1 = math.ceil(miles1/rangex)
    refill2 = math.ceil(miles2/rangex)
    print("You will need to make",refill1, "stops for leg 1 and", refill2, "stops for leg 2.")
    print("You will pay $", refill1*costperfill + refill2*costperfill, "for the trip in gas.")
    

loc = [first_city, pitstop_city,second_city]
distanceTimeCalc2(loc)



5.

	A) Asked traveler the start city and destination city : 

first_city = input("Where do you want to start your trip?: ")
while (first_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    first_city = input("Where do you want to start your trip?: ")
second_city = input("Where do you want to end your trip?: ")
while(second_city not in cities_list):
    print ("\nError please enter a valid city")
    second_city = input("Where do you want to end your trip?: ")


	B) 

def distanceTimeCalc3(locations):
    min_total = 10000000;
    for i in range(12):
        if (i != (cities_list.index(locations[0]) and cities_list.index(locations[1]))):
            miles1 = (int (travel_data[cities_list.index(locations[0]), i]))
            miles2 = (int (travel_data[i, cities_list.index(locations[1])]))
            temp = miles1 + miles2

            if (temp < min_total):
                min_total = temp;
                min_total_index = i;
    
    print("Your recommended pitstop is", cities_list[min_total_index])
    print("Between first city and second city you will travel", min_total, "miles.")
    avgSpeed = 75 #mph
    mpg = 24.9
    fuel = 16
    hours = min_total/avgSpeed
    d = 0 #days
    h = 0 #hours
    m = 0 #minutes
    if (hours >= 24):
        d = int (hours/24)
        hours = hours % 24
        h = int (hours)
        hours = hours % 1
        m = int (60 * hours)
    else:
        h = int (hours)
        hours = hours % 1
        m = int (60 * hours)
    print("Your trip from first_city to second_city will take", d, "days,", h, "hours and", m, "minutes.")
    
    rangex = mpg * fuel
    costperfill = 16*2.4
    refill1 = math.ceil(min_total/rangex)
    print("You will need to make",refill1, "stops.")
    print("You will pay $", refill1*costperfill, "for the trip in gas.")

loc = [first_city, second_city]
distanceTimeCalc3(loc)

		2)The pitstop is Washington.

		3) The statement printed like this :
Your recommended pitstop is Washington
Between first city and second city you will travel 885 miles.
Your trip from first_city to second_city will take 0 days, 11 hours and 48 minutes.
You will need to make 3 stops.
You will pay $ 115.19999999999999 for the trip in gas.
