    "### The second puzzle:\n",
    "- An alien at Proxima Centauri b looks toward our Sun with their telescope and records a transit (a planet crosses in front of the Sun disk). The planet caused a dip in the light the alien saw of $\\Delta$f=0.007456. The event repeated after 10,740 days. Using Doppler spectroscopy the alien found that the planet causes the Sun to wobble with a velocity semi-amplitude of 2.76m/s. Which planet did the alien see? If Mercury is 1, Venus is 2, this planet is N. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Find the Radius and Mass of the planet using the information from above and these tips:\n",
    "      - Tip for the transit: you know that $\\Delta$f $\\sim \\frac{R^2_{planet}}{R^2_{star}}$. Use this to find the radius of the planet in km, if you know that the Sun has a radius of 696,000km (5 points)\n",
    "      - Tip for the wobbling: you know that the velocity semi-amplitude is given by $K = \\frac{28.43 [m/s]}{\\sqrt{1-e^2}} \\frac{m_{planet}\\sin i}{m_{Jupiter}}(\\frac{m_{planet}+m_{Sun}}{m_{Sun}})^{-2/3} (\\frac{P}{1 year})^{-1/3}$. Use this to find the mass of the planet. You can assume that e = 0 and sini = 1. Also, note that $m_{planet} << m_{Sun}$ (5 points)\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Now that you now the Radius, Mass and Period of the planet, compare against this NASA database: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/ \n",
    "    - Which is the planet the alien saw? (3 points)\n",
    "    - What is the number N of the planet (if Mercury=1, Venus =2, etc)? Print an informative statement. (1 point)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- What is the number that is a common solution to the two puzzles? Populate your *key_code* with the number (1 points).  \n",
